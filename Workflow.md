# IPFS

IPFS hashes our data to get a unique hash.
Hashing is done by the IPFS node.
This unique hash will only points to the data.
This unique has can be pinned inside the IPFS node to create a decentralized nature
The IPFS node which pinned our hash, will be connected to all other IPFS nodes.
Some of the connected nodes, will look at the pinned data and create a copy of that and pin it to their nodes as well.
Now our hash is pinned to multiple nodes which talk to each other.
